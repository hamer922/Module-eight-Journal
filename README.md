The client is someone looking to build a business around helping students pass their driving test.
The system we have been asked to build provides students a way to study for for the writen driving test, take pratice test, and optional on the road traing. 
The UML diagrams went ok but its dificult to build UML object class diagram not knowing everthing that will be needed in each class. I think the user login/register activity diagram is something that I did well on this project.
User needs come from talking to them about what they need and asking them what they exspect from this product. The users are the ones who are going to be using the product so if we don't take that into consideration when making the design, the product won't meet their needs. 
The first step to design is gathering client/user requirements, next fill out the business requirements document, finaly build UML diagrams. These are the steps I will take in the future to analyze and design a system.
